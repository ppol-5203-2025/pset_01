# PPOL 5203 - Problem Set 1

This repository contains your first problem set for Data Science I: Foundations. 


## General Rules for Problem Sets


- (i) all code must run;

- (ii) solutions should be readable

    -   Code should be thoroughly commented (the Professor/TA should be able to understand the code's purpose by reading the comment),
    -   Coding solutions should be broken up into individual code chunks in Jupyter/R Markdown notebooks, not clumped together into one large code chunk (See examples in class or reach out to the TA/Professor if this is unclear),
    -   Each student defined function must contain a docstring explaining what the function does, each input argument, and what the function returns;



- (iii) Commentary, responses, and/or solutions should all be written in Markdown and explain sufficiently the outputs.

- (iv) All solutions  must be completed in Python.


There is no Python in this problem set. So take these rules as a general instruction. 


## Step by Step for the Problem Set. 

You should be familiar with the steps required to work on this repository. If not, you will be after completing this assignment and the in-class exercise from this week. 

If you follow the steps below, you should be able to solve all required tasks. 

## Working locally in your assignment

### step 1

First step is to clone your assignment to your local machine

```
git clone <repository_link>
```

This will create a folder in your local working directory. This folder is a local github repository. You should `cd` into that folder. 

### step 2

Your problem set is fully described in the notebook `_ps_set1.ipynb`. 

You can open `ipynb` using jupyter notebook. 

Read your assignment carefully. 

You will be required to provide responses in the notebook and also creating new folders in this repository. 


### step 3

Submit your assignment via github, via staging, commit and push. 

- Remember: this is an individual assignment.
- Your deadline for submission is Friday, September 26, until 23:59
- I will consider your last commit as your final submission.
- Save your notebook as `<_yourname__ps_set1.ipynb>`


If you have any questions, ask me or your TA. 


Enjoy!!
